These examples are far from extraordinary.  They're meant to get across to the user the key features available in the Collision Detection Kit.  As such, you're sure to see code that can be optimized and other methods that could have been utilized.  Thankfully, you are welcome to do with these files as you see fit, and I encourage experimentation.  There are plenty of variables used that can be tweaked and changed to produce varied results, so do so!

Since the work being done in these examples is essentially the same for each, I have only commented the code in Opening.fla and put a small note in OverlapExample.fla, so head over to those files if you'd like to read some sentence fragments. :P

Just to remind you, you will need to assign the class path for the CDK in these FLAs before you can compile.

And I'd like to quickly reiterate what I mention in the Opening.fla file; the equations used in these examples come from work done in the book "ActionScript 3.0 Animation - Making Things Move!" by Keith Peters.  It's an excellent resource for anyone looking to cut their teeth on scripted animation, and the inspiration for my writing the CDK in the first place.  Thanks, Keith!

And thanks to everyone using this kit!  It's been a big help for me, and I'm glad it can be for you, too. :)
