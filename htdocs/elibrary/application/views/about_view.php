     This site has been developed by me, aka Haisum Bhatti, an student of SZABIST's BS SE 2008 batch.
     Site's purpose is to provide Intranet based interface to students of SZABIST to share Ebooks
     within the campus. For feedback feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:haisumbhatti@gmail.com">haisumbhatti@gmail.com</a>.

    As acknowledgement, I would like to thank Sir Asim Riaz Sheikh and Muhammad Ahmed for their useful contributions.
